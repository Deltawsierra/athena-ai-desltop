/**
 * Where an engagement stands against OWASP ASVS 4.0.3.
 *
 * The whole risk in a compliance screen is that it makes an untested control
 * look like a passing one. A product whose scanners bear on 21 of the
 * standard's 286 requirements, rendering 286 rows with 265 of them green, has
 * told a customer something false about the other 265 -- and it is the most
 * convincing kind of false, because the 21 are real.
 *
 * So a requirement is in one of four states and never fewer:
 *
 *   failing      a finding from this engagement's scans maps to it
 *   tested       a scanner that can produce such a finding ran, and did not
 *   not_covered  nothing this engine tests for bears on this requirement
 *   not_run      something bears on it, but that scanner was not loaded
 *
 * `not_covered` and `not_run` are kept apart because they call for different
 * actions: the first is a limit of the product, the second is a deployment
 * that turned something off. Collapsing either into `tested` is the failure
 * this module exists to prevent, and collapsing them into each other hides a
 * misconfiguration behind a limitation.
