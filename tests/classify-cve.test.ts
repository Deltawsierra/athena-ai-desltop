/**
 * A classifier that says nothing must not look like one that said something.
 *
 * This screen printed "SQL Injection, 92% confident" for every input, both
 * constants. It was then rebuilt to stop classifying, on the stated grounds
 * that the engine had no such route — which was false; POST /api/classify-cve
 * has been there all along. Both versions were wrong in the same way: a claim
 * made without checking.
 *
 * The engine's model knows five classes, so an input carrying no signal comes
 * back at exactly the floor with whichever label wins the tie-break, which is
 * always `rce`. Rendering that as a finding would be the third version of it.
