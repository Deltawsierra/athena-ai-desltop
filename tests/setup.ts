 * imports anything from `server/` at the top pulls in storage-unified, which
 * chooses its backend at module load, before makeApp has run. Two files doing
 * that shared the real ./athena.db on disk, so a kill switch thrown in one
 * file answered 503 to another, and rows created in one were counted by the
 * next. This runs first, so the choice is always the in-memory backend.
