 * issue as many.
 *
 * And `fixed` is reachable only from a retest the engine answered `closed`.
 * Measured against a live engine, a target that is simply switched off answers
 * `inconclusive`; a lifecycle that treated that as a fix would report a host
 * going down as a vulnerability remediated.
