# Athena AI - Cybersecurity Intelligence Platform (Desktop Edition)

## Overview
Athena AI Desktop is a futuristic, JARVIS-inspired, comprehensive cybersecurity platform designed to run entirely offline as a standalone desktop application. Its core purpose is to provide real-time threat monitoring and analysis, CVE classification, automated penetration testing, security audit logging, compliance tracking, and robust admin controls. The project aims to deliver a powerful, offline-first cybersecurity solution with a highly interactive and visually engaging user experience.

## User Preferences
When making changes:
1. Follow existing code patterns
2. Test animations on multiple screen sizes
3. Run architect review for significant changes
4. Update this documentation
5. Ensure all tests pass

## System Architecture

### Core Design
The platform transitioned from a web application to a desktop application using **Electron**, ensuring complete offline functionality. Data storage migrated from cloud PostgreSQL to a local **SQLite** database, managed by **Drizzle ORM**. The application uses a session-based authentication system suitable for a desktop environment. The UI/UX emphasizes a modern, visually engaging experience with advanced, performant animations, glass morphism design elements, and an intuitive navigation structure.

### Technical Implementations
- **Desktop Framework**: Electron for cross-platform compatibility.
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Wouter for routing, Shadcn/UI for components, Tailwind CSS for styling, Recharts for data visualization, and React Query for state management.
- **Backend**: An embedded Express server handles API requests and interacts with the SQLite database.
- **Animation System**: Utilizes Framer Motion for advanced spring animations, Lenis for smooth scrolling, and custom CSS utilities for GPU-accelerated effects, focusing on performance, accessibility, and natural motion.
- **Admin Features**: Expanded with dedicated pages for AI Control Panel (emergency kill switch, override), AI Chat Interface, Deletion Management, and ML Classifier management.
- **Database Schema**: Includes tables for `users`, `scanResults`, `cveResults`, `auditLogs`, `clients`, `tests`, `documents`, `aiControlSettings`, `aiChatMessages`, and `classifiers`.

### Key Features
- **Dashboard**: Real-time threat monitoring with animated ticker tape, metric cards, and interactive charts.
- **CVE Classifier**: Automated analysis and severity classification of CVEs.
- **Pentest Scanner**: Automated penetration testing with configurable scans and real-time progress.
- **Admin Panel**: User management, role assignment, system configuration, AI health monitoring, and centralized deletion.
- **AI Features**: AI Chat interface, AI Control Panel for system overrides, and ML Classifier management for threat detection.
- **Clients & Tests**: Comprehensive management of client information, security test tracking, and document handling.
- **Audit Logs**: Detailed security event logging for compliance and analysis.
