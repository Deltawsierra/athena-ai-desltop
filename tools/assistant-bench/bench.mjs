/**
 * Does a local model answer questions about this deployment, and how often does
 * it make something up?
 *
 * Two numbers come out, and the second one decides everything:
 *
 *   accuracy     of the questions with a real answer, how many it got right
 *   fabrication  of the questions whose honest answer is "I do not have that",
 *                how many it answered anyway
 *
 * A model that scores well on the first and badly on the second is the worst
 * outcome available -- fluent, confident, and inventing findings into a
 * customer's security record. That is the failure this whole product has been
 * built against, and it is the one a smaller model is most likely to bring
 * back. So the traps outnumber nothing: they are half the question set.
 *
 * Two context modes are run, because "the model is too weak" and "the context
 * is too thin" are different problems with different fixes:
 *
 *   summary     exactly what the product sends today -- counts and eight test
 *               headlines, from server/summary.ts, imported rather than copied
 *   retrieval   what tools would return: the findings themselves, scoped to the
 *               client the question is about
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/assistant-bench/bench.mjs \
 *     --url http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 --model qwen2.5:7b-instruct \
 *     --db /path/to/athena.db
 *
 * Works against anything speaking OpenAI-compatible /chat/completions --
 * Ollama, llama.cpp's server, LM Studio. Nothing leaves the machine.
