/**
 * "Some of what you are looking at was written by the installer."
 *
 * A fresh install seeds three clients, four sites and three tests so the app
 * has something to show. Two of those tests carry severity counts, and the
 * dashboard adds them into its totals -- so out of the box it reported
 * twenty-three findings and three criticals against an estate nobody had
 * scanned. Every one of those figures was derived from a real database row,
 * which is exactly what made it convincing and exactly why it had to stop.
 *
 * So the notice states the numbers rather than hedging. "Some of this is
 * sample data" is the kind of sentence a reader discounts; "23 of the
 * findings below were written by the installer" is one they act on. And the
 * button beside it is the point: a claim like this is only worth making if it
 * comes with the means to make it false.
