/**
 * Prove it was fixed.
 *
 * The engine keeps a decision twin for every real finding a scan produced --
 * the inputs that produced it and the verdict it produced -- so a retest can
 * compare like with like rather than comparing today's scan to a remembered
 * summary. Nothing in this app ever asked for one.
 *
 * The verdict is the engine's word, rendered as three states because there are
 * three and they are not two. `inconclusive` is not a soft `closed`: the engine
 * says it whenever the finding's absence is explainable by something other than
 * the finding being gone -- a scan that did not complete, or a detector set
 * that is no longer the approved one. Measured against a live engine with the
 * target simply switched off, the verdict came back `inconclusive` with the
 * connection error as its detail. A panel that collapsed this into fixed/not
 * fixed would tell a customer that a host going down was a vulnerability
 * remediated, so inconclusive is styled as a warning and says in words that it
 * is not proof of a fix.
